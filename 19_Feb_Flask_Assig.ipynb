    "\"\"\"Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, allowing developers to quickly build web applications. Some advantages of using Flask framework are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Flask follows a minimalist approach, providing only the essentials for web development. It has a small codebase and is easy to understand and work with, making it ideal for small to medium-sized projects or prototyping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: Flask provides a flexible framework that allows developers to make choices based on their specific project requirements. It doesn't enforce any particular way of doing things, giving developers the freedom to structure their applications according to their preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Design: Flask is designed with a modular approach, allowing developers to add or remove components as needed. It provides a wide range of extensions that can be easily integrated to add functionalities like database integration, authentication, and more.\"\"\"\n"

    "\n",
    "logging.info(\" about App routing in Flask and its uses\")\n",
    "'''\n",
    "App routing in Flask is the process of defining the URL paths that a web application will respond to.\n",
    "In Flask, you define app routes using the @app.route() decorator, which associates a URL pattern with a \n",
    "function that will handle requests to that URL.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "'''\n",
    "For example, consider the following Flask app route:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "@app.route('/hello')\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    return 'Hello, World!'\n",
    "'''\n",
    "In this example, the @app.route() decorator associates the URL pattern /hello with the hello() function.\n",
    "Whenever a client makes a request to the URL http://<server>/hello, Flask will call the hello() function and \n",
    "return the string \"Hello, World!\" as the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why we use app routes in Flask:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Better organization: App routing allows us to organize our application logic into discrete functions that handle specific requests. \n",
    "This makes it easier to manage and scale our application as it grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved user experience: By defining app routes, we can create user-friendly URLs that are easy to remember and navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced security: App routing allows us to restrict access to certain parts of our application and \n",
    "enforce security measures such as authentication and authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved SEO: App routing can help improve the search engine optimization (SEO) of our application by \n",
    "creating descriptive URLs that are more likely to appear in search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, app routing is an essential part of building web applications in Flask.\n",
    "By defining app routes, we can organize our application logic, provide a better user experience, enhance security, and improve SEO.\n",
